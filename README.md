# beginner-js-coding-quiz

## Description of work completed
In this assignment, I created a basic coding quiz where the user automatically advances through a series of questions and answers while timed.  They are alerted if they got a question correct or incorrect immediately.  If they choose an incorrect answer, the time decrements at a faster pace than if they are correct.  At the end of the quiz, they can enter their intials to be included on the highscores page.  A demo of the site can be viewed [here](Assets/04-web-apis-homework-demo.gif) and the live site can be found [here](https://emblair96.github.io/HW4-code-quiz/).  

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery v.3.2.1
* GitHub

### Areas for improvement

* I was not able to determine how to get the time to stop counting down when using the "View Highscores" hyperlink in the upper left-hand corner if the user had already started the quiz.  I would like to learn how to correctly stop the setTime in the addEventListener for the View Highscores element.

* I did not have time to attempt to have the high scores display in numerical order from highest to lowest.  This is something I would like to experiment with as a continued learning experience.  

### What I learned from this assignment

* Continued to build on my understanding of functions, as well as local storage

* Discovered the usefulness for adding and removing classes to display/hide content

* Gained a better understanding of how to traverse the DOM

* Reinforced the importance of pseudo code as a starting point
