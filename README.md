# beginner-js-coding-quiz

## Description of work completed
Here, I created a basic coding quiz where the user automatically advances through a series of questions and answers while timed.  They are alerted if they got a question correct or incorrect immediately.  If they choose an incorrect answer, the time decrements at a faster pace than if they are correct.  At the end of the quiz, they can enter their intials to be included on the highscores page.

Here's a quick look at what this app can do.

### Technologies

### What I learned from this assignment

* Continued to build on my understanding of functions, as well as local storage

* Discovered the usefulness for adding and removing classes to display/hide content

* Gained a better understanding of how to traverse the DOM

* Reinforced the importance of pseudo code as a starting point
