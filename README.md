# HW4-code-quiz

## Description of work completed
In this assignment, I created a basic coding quiz where the user automatically advances through a series of questions and answers while timed.  They are alerted if they got a question correct or incorrect immediately.  If they choose an incorrect answer, the time decrements at a faster pace than if they are correct.  At the end of the quiz, they can enter their intials to be included on the highscores page.  A demo of the site can be viewed [here](Assets/04-web-apis-homework-demo.gif) and the live site can be found [here](https://emblair96.github.io/HW4-code-quiz/).  

### Areas for improvement


### What I learned from this assignment

* Continued to build on my understanding of functions, as well as local storage

* Discovered the usefulness for adding and removing classes to display/hide content

* Gained a better understanding of how to traverse the DOM

* Reinforced the importance of pseudo code as a starting point

### Credits
Some helpful resources I used to create this quiz include [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA&t=620s) YouTube video by Web Dev Simplified, as well as [this](https://webdevtrick.com/create-javascript-quiz-program/) blog post on Web Dev Trick.

And of course, I would also like to credit my Northwestern Bootcamp instructor, Lori Culberson, and the TAs for the course, Tony and Pat.
